# Data Visualization for COVID-19 and Malaria
Final Project for BU.520.650.51.SU20 Data Visualization
- Using R and Shiny

## Project Description
The COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. The geographic distribution of coronavirus is thus brought into sharper focus. Among the worst hit (up until when we did the project) was New York State. Thus, it is meaningful to see how each county within the state was impacted across time. Furthermore, COVID-19â€™s correlations (in terms of mortality rates and prevalence) with infectious diseases such as Malaria come into question. As a result, we have developed some visualizations to directly illustrate the varying mortality rates and incidence rates of COVID-19 and Malaria across different countries.

## Research Questions
### Research Question 1: How are the COVID-19 cases distributed in the New York State?
Since the New York State has been one of the states that suffered the most from the outbreak, we decide to plot choropleth maps to visualize a series of coronavirus data. The first dashboard shows the cumulative positive cases, new positive cases, total number of tests performed, and cumulative number of tests performed in the state.
### Research Question 2. How does the COVID-19 distribution correlate with that of Malaria?
As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads rapidly around the globe, there is an urgent need to aggressively tackle the novel coronavirus while ensuring that other killer diseases, such as Malaria, are not neglected. For the benefit of jointly addressing those two types of diseases, the second dashboard displays the death rates and incidence per 1,000,000 people of COVID-19 and Malaria on a world map, and a scatter plot shows their correlation directly.
